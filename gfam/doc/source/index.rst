This is the documentation of ``gfam``, a Python module to aid the automatic
annotation of gene families based on consensus domain architecture, written
by `Tamás Nepusz`_.

GFam is free and open-source. If you use GFam in your research, please cite
the corresponding publication as follows:

  | Sasidharan R, Nepusz T, Swarbreck D, Huala E and Paccanaro A:
  | **GFam: a platform for automatic annotation of gene families**.
  | *Nucleic Acids Research*, Advance Access, 2012.
  | doi:`10.1093/nar/gks631`_.

.. _10.1093/nar/gks631: http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/07/11/nar.gks631.full

GFam can generally be considered stable. We have used it successfully to
annotate the whole genome of *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Arabidopsis lyrata*.
Please email the author_ if you discover any bugs, or feel free to
`submit a bug report`_ on GitHub_.

If you are interested in the latest and greatest (but maybe unstable) version
of GFam, you can get it from GitHub_ - just click on the **Download source**
button on the GitHub_ page.
